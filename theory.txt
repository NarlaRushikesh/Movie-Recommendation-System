It is a complete project where we are going to clean the data and train the model and converting the model into a website and hosting it.

Types of Recommender systems:
1,Content based: Recommending based on the content(tags will be created.)
2,Collaborative filtering: based on user interest.
3,Hybrid: mixing of content and collaborative.

Project Flow:

Data -> Preprocessing -> Model -> Training -> Testing -> Website -> Deployment
(preprocesing: converting the data as per our needs.)

Dataset is collected from kaggle website(tmdb)
now, combine both the files movies and cast files for easily accessing
next, select the required columns and remove the remaining columns

remove null value rows from the movies

remove duplicates rows from the movies

we need to fix the genres and remaining data

we are creating an helper function for our requirements.
But the problem is we need list but, here it is a string of list.
So, we are using ast module to solve this issue.

applying that function to each and every column of genres

succesfully we changed genres and keywords column as per our requirments.

In, cast we need only top 3 characters. So, we need to modify our function.

In crew we need only director name so modify it accordingly


















after vectorization
we got our 5000 words, but in that list of words we have a problem of similar words like actor and actors.
apply stemming on the data
example: ['loving','loved','love]
it will return ['love','love','love']
